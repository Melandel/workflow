Montly cost (month M)
What were the reasons for the technology stack to be chosen? 
Which other alternatives have been considered, and why were they dismissed? 
Are the initial reasons still valid currently? 
Is the infrastructure scale or scaling strategy (on horizontal and vertical axis) matching the actual usage of the resource?
What are the usage metrics requiring this scale (CPU, memory, usage, throughput, peaksâ€¦)
Is there room to reduce scale or improve scaling strategy to better match the usage?
Is the cost surprising when compared to what one would expect from the resource based on the value it brings to the Information System?
Are there new technology stacks available that could be better suited to the use case?
Are these stacks well supported at Younited?
Have other teams used this stack? What is their feedback?
Would a POC help confirm the hypothesis?
Would this change require to drop some features? If so, would this be an issue?
Are there any recommendations reported by Azure to improve costs? or Is there a reason to dismiss these automatic recommendations?
Are there simple actions that could be taken to reduce costs?
Would purging some data help?
Is there room to reduce number of actions processed?
Would updating the dotnet framework/other third-parties version help?
