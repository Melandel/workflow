# Pioneering practices from around the globe

## Chapter 1: Purpose & Values
Higher corporate purposes and core values may sound air-fairy, but once you consider the potential benefits you may come to view them as imperative. Out Bucket List pioneers have proved that purpose pays off. It improves staff motivation and involvement and is directly linked to better financial results. Companies with a focus on a higher purpose perform up to 10 times better than the competition[12](). Consumers are willing to pay more for products and services from companies that focus on having a positive influence [13]().

In the Harvard Business Review, Professor Adam Grant and colleagues discuss what an organisation should do to attract and retain talent[14](). Their unsurprising findings: higher purpose and dent core values are strong motivators. How do you ensure that the purpose and values of an organisation become central? What have these 100-plus visits to pioneers shown us? What differentiates progressives? Here are some rebellious ways to make your organisation stand up and stand out.

### Level1: Have a bold purpose
Go in head-first! Then reach out to like-minded souls in companies, charities, suppliers, and your customers and employees. Encourage them to join the revolution - or at least contribute to yours. The purpose must tick boxes: it mush be authentic, honest, fearless and real. It is a corporate moral compass, helping to set a steady course in good times and bad. The higher purpose must provide a true sense of direction - especially in times of frustration or loss. No matter how confusing or challenging things become, your purpose is your rock. The most powerful examples provide answers to questions such as: Why does our company exist? Why do we do what we do? What is our added value? Who are we? Do we mean what we say? Who are we doing this for? What difference do we want to make? The answers must form guidelines and every action, every decision, every person.

### Level2: Get the message to everyone
The higher purpose must be shared. Whether it's your first day with the organisation or your last, whether you're the boss or not, the purpose doesn't change. Think back to Patagonia and the trips to the cotton fields. Consider the example set by Zappos, where all employees work in customer service before taking on other roles. These people get experience that helps them understand why things are done the way they are.

The higher purpose and core values must be applied in all areas. Make sure that every department, every team, every person is aware of their contribution.

### Level3: Hire for culture, train for skills
The founder of Southwest Airlines, Herb Kelleher, once said: "The business of business is people." Southwest hires for values. It understands that employees are the custodians of corporate culture. It pays to be ruthless in this area. You can train people to fly planes and serve passengers; bu you can't change who they are. That is why this airline works hard on attentive hiring that filters or redirects those unsuited to their roles within a six-month probationary period. A survey of employees showed 75 percent saw their job a "a calling", and 86 percent were proud to work for the airline[15](). Isn't that what it's all about?

### Level4: Measure impact, track progress, share it widely
Are you accomplishing your goals? Employees need to see their own role as part of the bigger picture. Knowing that your actions contribute to the greater good provides immense satisfaction. Measure, and be transparent, authentic and honest. Every year, Patagonia reveals its pollution rates and those of the non-profits it supports. Tony's Chocolonely measure how slavery develops within the cocoa industry, and honestly and openly communicates that information.

### Level5: Put your money where you mouth is
It doesn't matter how loud your voice is, your actions are all-important. Authenticity and credibility are lost when you fail to follow through. Patagonia halted profitable lines to cut pollution and donated its Black Friday profits to worth causes. It also directs one percent of its annual revenue to non-profits. Everyday it stands by its higher-purpose.

## Chapter 2: Network of Teams
The lessons learned during our visits to Haier and Handelsbanken are reinforced by many other pioneers. They understand that employees need autonomy and trust in order to perform well. Often after reaching a total of 30 to 50 employees (sometimes before), organisations feel the need to centralise. Managers are appointed, functional departments created, formal rules and procedures set up, and weekly alignment meetings planned. Everything will be done to cling to the illusion of control. Unfortunately, people start to moan about the growing bureaucracy and control mechanisms.

Progressives tackle this differently. Before they reach critical mass - 10 to 15 employees - they divide into two autonomous teams within the same network. As soon as one reaches the critical point, it divides again. Growth is organic. The idea is simple, but implementation won't always be easy. The secret is to motivate the teams to keep everything running well and ensure the proper and healthy functioning of the network. Consider the seven other trends described in this book. An inspiring mission allows teams to work as one with everyone playing their part (an important source of motivation). The teams are often multidisciplinary to reflect the tasks expected. They are responsible for the functionality of their mini-company, represent the point of contact for customers and must ensure that all issues are resolved. This often brings not only benefits to the client but also increases the engagement and motivation of employees. Although all this may sound utopian, it does result in pressure. When shit hits the fan, the team must resolve problems by themselves.

With this intricate, growing network the question arises: How can their work be coordinated efficiently and yet avoid the trap of countless meetings? The answer is to ensure that as much information as possible is available. This calls for an IT system that has been developed to allow effective communication. Buurtzorg, a health care organisation we will touch upon later, has a special and very active intranet that all teams must join. They share news here but may also ask other teams for help. Buurtzorg organises a yearly congress where people get the change to take part in workshops. Spotify has guilds, groups of employees who work in different teams but share expertise an interests. They meet on a regular basis, and while most guilds are work-related, some focus on hobbies and leisure.

The is a middle way, while others seek out the radical extremes. Here is an overview of possible structures. The first is the least radical, the fifth the most. But they are all improvements.

### Level1: Inverted Pyramid
The days of frustrating and unrealistic vertical command-and-control communications are numbered. Create a renewed structure by upending this pyramid. Progressives take this step convinced that, in the main, it is the employees on the work floor that create added value. An inverted pyramid means that employees work pretty much as before but will understand that the organisation supports them. This pyramid still has managers making most of the decisions, but they do so believing that they are assisting employees closest to the client, product, or service. The leaders and head office are there to help the decentralised units.

### Level2: Autonomous teams in pyramid
Many progressives regard the inverted pyramid as obstructive and inflexible. To counter this they may create small, autonomous teams in certain areas. The trend may start in the IT department with the "Agile" way of working. At Swedish Spotify, IT develops - who make up a third of the company - form root-like teams: small, intertwined, but autonomous. These have considerable responsibility for the end result and determine how they work: some choose to manage themselves - others work with a permanent leader. The rest of the employees work mainly in support functions based on a traditional hierarchy.

### Level3: Flat organisation with autonomous teams
The logical next step is to split the pyramid into autonomous teams, but for some that's too much, too soon. An interim solution is to create a flat organisation with minimal management layers. Handelsbanken has just three. The most important is comprised of the branches in direct contact with clients. The other layers are the regional offices and head office in Stockholm. The autonomous teams determine how they work, where they work, and with whom they work (but do not set performance goals).

### Level4: Network of teams
Those that do dare flatten the pyramid, organise themselves in a network that is waited on by a small but efficient " head office". Buurtzorg has over 1000 autonomous teams served by only 50 people. There is only one layer of hierarchy above the teams. Other examples include IT company Nearsoft, from Mexico; a group of production companies in the north of Spain; and the Municipality of Hollands Kroon. This structure allows the teams to determine their own way of working and carry full responsibility. In most cases, they ensure that multidisciplinary teams don't exceed 10 to 15 employees.

Divide the teams based on region, product, service (or client), and ensure an efficient IT system allows employees to work together well. Make sure you have a group of coaches (without decision making privileges) that can assist if called upon. Would you like more entrepreneurship? Create a healthy form of competition and give the teams skin in the game. They become little companies that decide when and where they work, how, and with whom.

### Level5: Ecosystem of mini-companies
The true radicals go one step further: as well as creating the network of mini-organisations by providing part ownership, and online platform is built to give access to stakeholders. This is exactly what Haier does with 70k employees organising themselves in over 4000 mini-companies spread across multiple online platforms. They worry about internal competition as well as pressure from external stakeholders. For example: Is the HR team fulfilling expectations? If not, an external party is brought in. This dynamic ensures that only the teams that add real value will remain. The role of top management is still to determine the long-term strategy, but other than that they focus mainly on investing in the mini-companies they believe in and funding the start-ups.

How many layers of management does your business have, and how many of those should go? Is there a pyramid that could be reshaped into something more productive? What do you need to get things moving? How can you create opportunities? Take a good look at your organisation, because - as you're about to see - you don't have to be CEO to begin.

## Chapter 3: Supportive leadership
Weinzweig and Childs are progressive leaders running companies in their own authentic way. They share many common values. Each person is unique, so there are many ways in which supportive leadership can be brought to life. But how do you succeed in creating this? What are the points to keep in mind? How can you adjust the way things work within your team? What insights did our other visits give us? Here are some rebellious ways in which progressives distinguish themselves. We start on simple ploys and work up to the more radical solutions.

### Level1: Beware of HiPPOs
This archaic style of leadership isn't just costing and enormous amount of money, it also leads to dubious work practices. We regularly experienced the HiPPO-effect (Highest-Paid Person's Opinion). This refers to the habit of siding with the highest-ranking officer (and therefore often the one drawing the top salary) and not acknowledging the person who has the most expertise, experience, or the brightest ideas. The traditional workplace tends to overlook the content of a problem simply to please the most senior person. The ineffectiveness of this has been scientifically proven.

A study carried out at the Rotterdam School of Management[22]() shows that projects supervised by junior managers have a high success rate. Their colleagues feel more comfortable expressing themselves, less intimidated. Senior managers are as prone as anyone to blunders and giving them more say backfires. Progressives do their best to avoid this in a direct and lighthearted way, for example by placing "Beware of HiPPOs" signs on the wall. A staff member of the UK's National Health Service (NHS) - inspired by our Bucket List experiences - warned those attending meetings to "park your hierarchy at the door". They saw progress in just a few days. People had the confidence to come forward with suggestions and dared to engage in discussions with senior staff. Moral of the story? Make decisions based on content, not the bringer of the content.

### Level2: Destroy the Ivory Tower
A fair number of traditional organisations shower privilege and status symbols on the higher ranks: reserved parking spaces, corner offices, business-class flights. These are hangovers from the Industrial Revolution. Hopefully, we can look back in a couple of years and wonder why on earth we used to do it that way.

Maintaining the ivory tower is not just outdated, it is bad for business. The tower undermines the pretty but often empty words in annual reports which proudly proclaim that "employees are the backbone of the business". Get rid of the nonsense and create a more inclusive environment. The inspiring leaders we met have paved the way. An excellent example is to be found at a group of 50 companies we visited in Bilbao, Spain. During the group's transformation, as we will see in a later chapter, they abandoned all privileges from day one.

### Level3: Evaluate your manager
Organisations espouse a desire for supportive leadership, but often little transpires. This is not surprising if the way in which you make judgments and dole-out rewards is unchanged. Progressives swap the top-down reward system for a bottom-up model.

How can the boss ascertain how well a manager leads? A proper feedback system will listen to the people best suited to make that evaluation: team members. Rebellious organisations dare to do this. Leaders with the right stuff make these sessions open.

### Level4: Split managers
Hierarchy itself is not the problem. Artificial hierarchy is. When authority isn't based on competence or quality of leadership, the result is the dreaded Peter Principle - a concept that has been understood for decades but is still with us. Laurence J Peter's book of 1969[23]() describes it well: "In a hierarchy every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence."

Imagine you are a sales rep. and an incredibly good one. This does not go unnoticed. Boss and colleagues are so impressed that you are hailed as a real talent. And a talent deserves promotion: from now on, you are a sales manager! Naturally, you are pleased, and probably get an increase in salary or a bigger car. You have new responsibilities that make you pleasurably busy and fill you with importance. You can't wait to share this on your LinkedIn page.

But this sort of promotion doesn't make sense. Why take someone who excels in sales and give them the role of managing people? Management requires a different skill set. Being good at one thing does not necessarily mean that you'll excel at another. A study published in Harvard Business Review[24]() came to the same conclusion. Many organisations we have visited make short work of the Peter Principle by creating multiple promotion tracks. If you're a great IT programmer, you don't necessarily need a management position as recognition. You can become an expert in your field and a mentor. Reward structures must be meaningful.

An organisation that is ace at doing this is the Polish IT company U2i, in Krakow. When we visited their office, we learned of their extraordinary approach. As employee Pawel Kozlowski said, "the only way to move up was to push somebody down the stairs". This diseased system has been put to pasture. The new way allows every employee to grow within his or her area of expertise.

### Level5: Choose your leader
Why are inspiring leaders so thin on the ground? Perhaps our traditional way of organising leadership is at fault. Imagine a workplace where leaders are elected after providing a good example. Or where people can share their opinions and provide feedback without fear of consequences, where opinions are judged purely on content. This could improve the atmosphere as well as motivation and productivity. It's clear that the traditional way of management and leadership often stands in the way of success. In our search, we have had conversations with gurus such as Tom Peters, Frédérix Laloux and Isaac Getz. We have also spoken with radical leaders such as Kees Pater, CEO of the Dutch cookie factory Veldt, Jean-François Zobrist, former CEO of the French FAVI, Mario Kaphan, founder of the Brazilian Vagas.com, and CEO Bob Hutten of the eponymous Dutch catering company.

Of the 100-plus Bucket List organisations we have visited, most have one thing in common: a lack of directive leadership. Instead we find supportive senior staff that lead by example, who ask their employees to the way to help and support them. They show and admirable combination of authenticity, modesty, rebelliousness and stubbornness. They have a clear vision and inspire their people to action. At the same time, they are available for feedback and criticism. They listen to the ideas of those on the front line. This is Supportive Leadership. 

"If you want to be a leader, you'd better find some followers." That motto may be tongue-in-cheek, but it's a wonderful piece of advice. Letting employees choose their own leader is one of the most rebellious solutions. Those that have the strength to do this will be rewarded. Create a voting process, allow people to select their mentors, or go for continuously changing leadership; the way you achieve this doesn't matter, just go for it.

Swiss IT company Hayfe Umantis was the most radical in this regard. All positions of power are democratically chosen - even that of the CEO. This might not be something to start tomorrow, but it is a powerful example of radical change for the better. The beauty of selecting leadership is that those who are chosen can really lead. And if things don't work out the team can always find a replacement...

## Chapter 4: Experiment & Adapt
American academic Leon Megginson observed in his 1963 interpretation of Charles Darwin's central thesis that it is neither the strongest nor the smartest of the species that survives, but the most adaptable. This is an essential insight for businesses struggling to meet unprecedented challenges. Competition is changing, the customer base is changing, the technology is changing; so is the market. Systems no longer last for generations and may only be useful for a few years, or even months. Businesses that become too attached to the status-quo are often the ones who most fiercely defend it. They should realise that they are the ones that will ultimately lose. Businesses that constantly experiment will be the winners.

Progressives see this new reality not as a problem but as an exciting challenge. They know that they will never "get there". In this process of experimentation, speed is essential: rapid change requires rapid response. "Progressives know that success belongs to the fast learner. Spotify embraces this notion." Although at first glance the group of companies from Bilbao and Spotify might not appear to have much in common, you may be surprised. Both have been able to adjust to this new reality of rapid change. This is exactly why progressive organisations abolish the old prediction and control mechanisms. They say goodbye to the rigid budget cycle, stifling coordination meetings, and the questionable decisions mindset. They know that adaptability is a must and focus on building the appropriate culture. The key to success is to experiment often, fail quickly, and keep improving. Just to be clear: these pioneers know that the most valuable experiments are the result of intense interaction between employees, customers and other stakeholders. They are not the result of a mystical view of the future by a group of overpaid consultants or astrologers.

Progressives pioneer alternative ways and are an important source of inspiration for ruthless experimentation and adaptation. They show the path to follow. Here is a starting point: once again, we look first at the easy steps.

### Level1: Ruthlessly experiment
Nike had it right all along. When it comes to experimentation the best advice is: just do it. Action is the most powerful antidote to the corporate disease of "analysis paralysis". To break through action is needed. Take inspiration from the factory workers from Bilbao and the developers at Spotify. Follow their lead and start experimenting yourself. Realise that change should no longer be a once-a-year event. It is a part of everyday work. It is always better to experiment and fail than never to try something new. An idea for a new product or service? Experiment! Improve your way of working? Experiment! Skip those useless alignment meetings? Experiment! Try out new ideas and make evidence-based decisions about how best to move forward.

Don't give up too quickly. Matt Perez, founder of Mexican IT company Nearsoft, inspired us with this principle: "We wish to create a culture of experimentation. So, when a person or team wants to experiment with something new - and there is enough internal support - they're free to give it a try. If we decide to go for it, we usually commit for at least one year. We want to learn and innovate by trial and error. See if it actually works."

### Level2: Kill the budget cycle
Dispense with your annual management processes that are based on wild guesswork, involve fixed targets and largely revolve around office politics. Get rid of your detailed annual budgeting cycles, your fixed yearly targets and goals. If the Swedish bank Handelsbanken (with thousands of employees) can do this why shouldn't you? Only plan and forecast if it seems vital. In such cases, arrange the processes in a more dynamic way by establishing short-term (i.e. monthly or weekly) goals and rolling forecasts. Make sure everyone is aware of how the business attempts to make sense of those goals and allocate resources on demand where they seem to be most needed.

### Level3: Create a "safe-to-try" environment
Experiment properly and fail masterfully. Whether you like it or not, the two belong together. You must ensure that people feel safe with this. Otherwise you'll end up nowhere. If they fail, they should be rewarded not punished. You're not going to punish your child for falling over when learning to walk, right? Look at experimentation in the same way. Without falling you'll never truly rise. Simply ask the question: "Is it safe enough to try?" That's all you need to know. Evaluate, learn, adapt. See it as progress. Various pioneers hold regular "Fuck-Up" events. People share their biggest disasters and tell the crowd what they have learned. Do you fancy holding such an event? Make sure the leaders are the first to share. Hand out awards for the best failures and create special moments to celebrate experimentation. This will create the environment you're looking for and encourage others. Experimentation should be fun and exciting, not threatening.

### Level4: Crowdsource experiments
Set up a crowdsourcing platform and invite employees to join. Create a bottom-up movement. Large-scale change programmes fail 70 percent of the time. The problem is that they are often initiated and managed from on-high but seldom supported by front line staff - who will effect the change. Build a crowdsourcing platform that allows anyone to do something new - like the factory workers at Haier. Invite everyone to participate and come up with suggestions, let them recruit their fellow rebels and launch the most popular experiments.

### Level5: Rebel time
Go further, give everyone the time they need to rebel. There are many ways to go about this. One is to create dedicated experimentation time through the appointment of full-time rebels - a select bunch who constantly push things forward. At Spotify developers enjoy a "10 percent hack time" to work on anything they want. A Belgium governmental department encourages employees to devote 15 per cent of their time in this way. Google used to have the famous 20 per cent rule where employees could spend a fifth of their time on self-initiated projects. With wonderful results: some of their most important products like Gmail and AdSense came from this.

## Chapter 5: Freedom & Trust
The Belgian ministry, Dutch law firm BvdV and VERSA are great examples of progressives that organise themselves according to freedom and trust. They replace old-fashioned management theories with new ideas, liberate themselves from rules and checks, and respect their employees. And they reap wonderful rewards.

Disclaimer: This does not mean that everyone does whatever they want. When nobody looks at the hours you work, only results, you must deliver. When control mechanisms go, you can't hide behind the rules. You will have to use your own judgement. Progressives want you to make full use of your brain and work autonomously. Traditional management is replaced by common sense and a compassionate, inclusive agenda. We have some ideas to inspire you...

### Level1: Design your own workplace
Empower employees: give them the freedom to design and decorate. It's a simple way to provide the first level of autonomy. Let them decide what they need; often this is down to a variety of spaces: silent places, meeting rooms, and a comfortable spot for relaxation. Think back to the IT team at the Belgian ministry. Some people need an open space, others prefer and office without windows. Provided the choice lies with the employees, you're always doing the right thing.

### Level2: Results-based working
If you judge employees by results, you should work in a result-oriented manner. How to set and reach targets, how to measure performance - these metrics vary. Some decide team goals on a weekly basis and make this visible on a wall or whiteboard - or use an online tool, such as Trello. It's all about being able to evaluate progress. How the employees manager this is their own affair. This results-orientated way of working is a boost for motivation and ensures that employees contribute.

### Level3: Remove control mechanisms
Chuck the time-clock out of a top-floor window, forget fixed working hours, give your employees freedom. Provide unlimited holidays, burn those fat folders of policy documentation, stop creating rules for the three percenters, and encourage common sense. If you don't trust your employees, why did you hire them in the first place? Does everything go wrong when you show trust? Are people not turning up for work? If so, perhaps there is no fire in their bellies. If, on the other hand, no one is taking their annual leave, you have a whole other issue to sort out (and this happens surprisingly often). Address the cause of problems, not the symptoms. Provide freedom and trust and start doing the real work.

### Level4: Peer review
Top-down control and reviews are standard in most traditional companies. Cut it out! It serves nobody. Progressives show there's another way. Let workers be accountable to their colleagues, not to the boss. Create an environment where this is possible. Learn how to provide valid, regular feedback. Create a culture of transparency.

### Level5: Self-setting salaries
The true radials allow workers the freedom to determine their own pay level. Various companies are doing this - and it works. Traditionally, salary setting is accompanied by secrets, gossip, politics, and dishonesty. The result is an often-uneasy consensus. At progressive places, people are forced to think about real added value. They know that after setting their own goals and evaluation themselves, determining their own pay is the next step.

## Chapter 6: Distributed Authority
An important feature of traditional organisations is central authority. This implies that decision-making competence rises according to ones position in the hierarchy, but the claim is complete nonsense. Progressives tend to be decentralised. The crew of the USS Santa Fe and democratic Haufe-Umantis show that decision-making can be spread throughout the organisation, resulting in higher productivity and better decision-making.

Many progressive organisations continuously adapt to a rapidly changing work environment. They understand that centralised decision-making processes cause the organisation to be slow-footed. That is why they often rely on the individuals and teams closest to the front line. These employees know the customers, suppliers and facilities best, and must take the lion(s share of the decisions. Distributed authority and decision-making processes and trending, but don't relax too soon: the freedom to take decisions is accompanied by responsibility.

So, how can you start? This is what some of the pioneers do.

### Level1: Map decision-making
Teams may not know if they're allowed to take a certain decision. Leaders may struggle to let go of authority. Many solve this with a simple first step. They map the current situation and provide an overview of who does what. If you don't over-complicate things, this can be fixed in a single morning. Don't worry about questions that arise once in a blue moon, just consider the basics. The rest will follow.

How long do you go about doing this as a team? Simple: gather your colleagues and clarify who makes which decisions. Discuss whether this makes sense. We see the following divisions within many progressive companies:
* simple decisions: just do it. Progressives believe it's better to ask forgiveness rather than permission
* medium to big decisions: advice process

Make sure that this overview of decision-making is visible afterwards, so that everyone knows where they stand. We want to prevent further chaos!

### Level2: Change the language
David Marquet on the USS Santa Fe changed the language of the organisation and showed that this can be a powerful step towards distributed decision-making. Try to replace passive phrases with ones that imply initiative and ownership.

Managers can also change their language. Instead of giving answers, they should be asking questions. When employees ask for permission or approval, simply ask "What do you propose?". A great and simple way to distribute decision-making.

### Level3: Push authority down
Once it is clear who makes the decisions it's time to distribute authority down the chain of command. Ensure that everyone seeks out practices that hold people back. Search for pesky mechanisms that keep the command-and-control culture in place. For example: managers who have to sign-off on travel expenses or approve working from home. You can also follow the steps of another of David Marquet's best practices (which we adapt slightly):
* Sit down with your team and map the decision-making (see point 1)
* Team leader(s) identify decisions they want to take by them selves
* Let leaders express any concerns. If they feel some people cannot or should not make certain decisions, this is the time to say why.
* Together alleviate the concerns as much as possible. Train, educate, or inform people so that they can make the decisions. It's about pushing decision-making down.

The first step in changing the genetic code of any organisation or system is delegating control, or decision-making authority, as much as is comfortable, and then adding a pinch more. This isn't an empowerment programme. It's changing the way the organisation controls decisions in an enduring, personal way.

### Level4: Pre-approval
Henry Stewart, CEO of the British training bureau Happy, introduced us to another interesting idea: pre-approval. A leader or manager approves something in advance, before the employee has made a decision or found a solution. The approval is given on one condition: adhere to the predefined boundaries. What is the maximum amount of money to be spent? What are its minimum requirements? How much time is allowed? This process allows employees to make their own decisions. Whatever they come up with will be put into practice.

### Level5: Advice process
This is a most radical way of distributing decision-making authority. It provides an alternative to slow consensus and is something we have seen in many organisations. Here's what it looks like:
* Someone takes the initiative to solve a problem or grasp an opportunity.
* He or she proposes a decision, with or without input from colleagues.
* The decision-maker seeks advice from people directly involved and/or more experienced colleagues.
* This advice can be heeded or ignored. The decision-maker has the final say.
* The decision-maker ensures that all involved are informed about the advice received and the eventual decision.

These steps show clearly that the process is not about reaching a consensus. Not everyone has to agree, not every source has to be taken into account. The decision-maker should get enough advice to make an informed decision.

## Chapter 7: Radical Transparency
Radical transparency is an important characteristic of progressives. People feel more involved, perform better, have more trust and faith in their leaders. Some balk at this, but it can be achieved in various ways:

### Level1: Open communication
Everyone should be involved in the process. A popular way to ensure this is to hold brief daily meetings where team members share what they are working on and can indicate where they need help. Regular commitment meetings will allow teams to discuss the coming week. Social media channels can provide a model. Some organisations employ ready-to-use software such as Slack, Facebook Workplace, Microsoft Teams, or Yammer.

Leaders should be communicators. Town hall meetings can benefit from a transparent Q&A session (such as UKTV's "Black Box").

### Level2: Openness as the default
Some progressives make all information public unless there is a very good reason not to. This open-by-default policy ensures that as many people as possible have access to relevant information. It brings better decision-making and a higher level of involvement. Again, there are tech solutions, such as Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive.

### Level3: Transparent performance and goals
Make sure that teams and individual members can compare their performance with that of others. An online comparison table can create a healthy sense of competition. At Buurtzorg, the healthcare people we discuss in the next chapter, teams use this to improve the way they deliver care. Don't let transparency be limited to financial goals and performance figures. Make sure that the information motivates people to achieve a higher purpose. Think back to Patagonia and Tony's Chocoloney, where progress towards their purpose was communicated transparently.

### Level4: Open-book management
At Zingerman's, we encountered a powerful way of working: making financials transparent. At its Roadhouse we took part in one of the weekly open-book management sessions. Two hours before the restaurant opens, all 30 employees discuss the results of the previous week. Revenue, cost, and customer satisfaction are all touched upon. Everyone gives their undivided attention and expresses an opinion. The kitchen porter was in the chair. He assumed responsibility and shared his feelings later. "At other jobs I was mainly expected to carry out my regular duties," he said, "but here I can use parts of my brain that I never used before. We all tun the company - and I can make a contribution." It is important to train people to understand the numbers. If you want enterprising employees, they must know how an enterprise work - including the financial side. Without proper knowledge acquisition, transparency doesn't mean much.

### Level5: Salary transparency
Many ascend to this level because they simply do not want to withhold anything. There is usually some excitement at first. People tend to look up each other's salaries out of curiosity. This persists for less time than you would expect. If the levels are fair, it's business-as-usual. Australian Bucket List pioneer Ken Everett experienced this at N2N. "Once the mystery is dispelled, so is the curiosity," he said.

What happens if salaries are made transparent and people feel they are unfair? Well, a great opportunity arise to fix a problem and nourish trust and commitment. Oh, and by the way, don't think there won't be feelings of unfairness when salaries are secret. If people don't know, they will guess. How o companies go about opening-up? Some are bold enough to publish all the information and see what happens. Others invite people to reveal their salaries. If you publish your own, you have the right to see others. It starts with a small group -- but the multitudes follow.

## Chapter 8: Talent & Mastery
How can aspiring progressives build on all this? We've seen how Buurtzorg and Nearsoft are organised. We've witnessed the practical applications and results that come with a strong focus on talent and mastery in the workplace. Here are five best practices we picked up along the way. As you may expect, we'll start with the basics and gradually work up to the more rebellious options.

### Level1: Identify talents
Many use a simple survey to discover talents and share the results. Templates can be found online. Surveys can also identify a talent gap. This allows reflection and insight into the current distribution of tasks.

### Level2: Job crafting by combining roles
If you don't like your current job, there are other possibilities. You can quit, find something new, or simply suck it up and continue suffering. Then, there's an alternative called job crafting. In the literature, it's defined as "self-initiated change behavior that employees engage in with the aim to align their jobs with their preferences, motives, and passions".

Job crafting is about turning your current job into one you enjoy more. And not just for the fun of it. Research shows it increases engagement and job satisfaction and decreases burnout.

Here are some tips on how best to approach this. The process builds on your team members' talents:
* Create an activities list
  Create a list of all the tasks a team needs to carry out. Record everything on Post-it notes and display them around the office.
* Merge activities into roles
  As a team, develop roles from activities that are similar or closely related. For example, creating social media posts, sending newsletters, and posting blogs might be combined into a marketing role. Another role may be financial, and include activities such as budgeting and invoicing
* Choose your role
  Now have team members select the roles that appeal to them. Forget job descriptions, and make sure managers do not force things. Base decisions on intrinsic motivation. A proper understanding of everyone's talent is vital.
* Don't forget unpopular roles
What do you do with the unappealing tasks? There's one solution we like: get rid of them! Simply stop assigning these roles. When doing so, the following may happen:
  1. Nothing bad happens. Team performance will remain the same or even improve. Your team will still perform. These tasks did not turn out to be so important after all.
  2. Problems arise. This is proof that the role is important. The solution? Start looking for alternatives. Create a priority for your next recruitment phase. Select someone who truly enjoys the role. Alternatively outsource it or find someone in a different team who enjoys doing this work. Be creative. There'll always be someone who's interested!

In Dubai we saw a good example of job crafting. The emirate's Knowledge and Human Development Authority has transformed several internal procedures and processes. Responsibilities for work and tasks are now assigned according to interests and talents. Fitness enthusiasts received training and now help their colleagues become healthier. This approach has been repeated for artists, photographers, filmmakers, poets, and writers.

### Level3: Unlimited training
Let employees decide how to up-skill. They can be trusted to make the right decisions.

At the Spanish online marketing company Cyberclick, we learned that employees decide their training budgets themselves. They can choose snorkelling or surfing lessons. Cyberclick believes that any training benefits employees and the company. No monitoring is required.

Bear this in mind:
* **CFO**: "What happens if we invest in developing our people and then they leave us?"
* **CEO**: "What happens if we don't, and they stay?"

### Level4: Self-selected mentors
Individuals develop better when surrounded by people they trust. At the Polish IT company U2i - where all internal titles have been removed - employees can offer themselves as mentors and choose their own.

Another IT company, Next Jump, based in New York, has a buddy system, Talking Partners (TP). It involves two employees regularly discussing their developing skills and talents (selected by themselves, of course). Talking Partners soon became known as TP. This was nicknamed Toilet Paper. Why? Because these people help you deal with your shit.

### Level5: Internal project marketplace
Some of the most progressive organisations have established an "internal marketplace". In Denmark we spoke with Lars Kolind, former CEO of hearing aids manufacturer Oticon. In the nineties, Lars eliminated all departments, management positions, and job titles. Projects were the driving force. Based on their interests, people took on as many as they wanted. Every task became a project.
